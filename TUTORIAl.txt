Scan the DLL using a red button that says "Scan DLL's" and it will take a while.
Search for a DLL (have to wait until all DLL's are scanned), enter in the file name, and then click "Search DLL". You enter the file name in the box above!
Above that to put a .dll in a folder you do "Select Folder / Path", find the folder you wanna put it in.
It will install another dll but put it into the folder you select, so if you want, delete the other one in downloads folder.
Once that is all done, click the button "Install In Path" then it will install in folder.
